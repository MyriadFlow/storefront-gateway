# Getting Started

## Postgres for development

```bash
docker run --name="marketplace" --rm -d -p 5432:5432 \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=lazarus \
-e POSTGRES_USER=lazarus \
-e POSTGRES_DB=lazarus \
postgres -c log_statement=all
```

## Wallet as an operator

Make sure you have an MNEMONIC which has operator role to its first address, if not then grant operator role to it and then proceed.

## Steps to get started

- Run `go get ./...` to install dependencies
- Set up env variables or create `.env` file as per [`.env-sample`](https://github.com/MyriadFlow/gateway/blob/main/.env-sample) file
- Run `go test ./...` to make sure setup is working
- Run `go run main.go` to start server

## API Reference

### Auth

For protected APIs use bearer token which can be obtained after calling authenticate API.

Use `Authorization` key in header in order to send token,
also since it is bearer token append `Bearer ` as suffix
for example, `Bearer mytokenabcd`

### APIs

#### Returns flow ID and EULA which should be signed and send to authenticate API in order to get the JWT which can be used for accessing all other APIs

```
  GET /flowid?walletAddress={{wallet address}}
```

#### Request JWT for the user who accepted the EULA by signing it with flow ID, i.e. flowid+EULA.

```
  POST /authenticate
```
